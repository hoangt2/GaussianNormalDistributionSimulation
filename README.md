# GaussianNormalDistributionSimulation
This simulation demonstrates how the Gaussian (normal) distribution emerges naturally when random processes are stacked.  Balls fall from the top and hit pegs. Each time a ball hits a peg, it has a 50% chance to go left or right.  After many balls, the distribution of balls in buckets approximates the bell curve of a normal distribution.
